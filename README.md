## Features

* **Opponent Block Functionality**:  
  A robust algorithm detects potential winning moves for the opponent and blocks them strategically.

* **Dynamic Board Representation**:  
  The 3x3 grid is represented as an array, making it easy to process and update the board's state.

### Opponent Block Functionality (`blockOpponentMove` Function)
* Identifies potential winning combinations for the opponent based on their recent move.
